# Deploying Django Apps by Nginx in AWS
# Introduction

Once we have completed the development part of a web app it should be hosted so that the public can access it from anywhere. We will see how to deploy and host a django application on AWS EC2 instance using Nginx as the webserver.
# AWS EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. We deploy and host our web apps on EC2 instance.
# NGINX

Nginx is an open-source web server that, since its success as a web server, is now also used as a reverse proxy , HTTP cache, and load balancer. We will use Nginx to server our webpages as needed .
